Excerpts from Population Section from Other Policy Issues 
issued by the US Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration

The U.S. does not endorse population “stabilization” or “control.” 
The “ideal” family size should be determined by the desires of 
couples, not governments. The U.S. strongly opposes coercive 
population programs.

Excerpts from Singapore’s Population Planning Campaign

Small families, brighter future. 
The more you have, the less they get.
Have three or more, if you can afford it.

Excerpts from Sweden’s Child Allowance under Employment, 
Social Affairs & Inclusion Section

If you live in Sweden and have children, you are entitled to 
child allowance. This is financial support that is automatically 
paid to all parents from and including the first month after birth 
until the child is 16 years old. 

If you have several children, you can also get large family 
supplement in addition to child allowance.

Excerpts from UNICEF’s Report on Tunisia

By 2030, Tunisia will face a 15 per cent increase in school-age 
population (aged 5-17), resulting in the need for approximately 
0.4 million additional students to be accommodated in the education 
system.

If Tunisia does not address this additional influx of children 
and adolescents into the education system in an adequate manner, 
additional 65 thousand children (aged 5-17), reflecting a 26 per 
cent increase, may be out of school.
